# LfA: Learning from Activation
---
This REPO proposes a novel debiasing method LfA.

Each Jupyter notebook is a demo of a different method.    
It is user-friendly, allowing you to see the training results and evaluation of each method with a single `Run all` button.

When you run it for the first time, it generates a dataset (colored MNIST) for model training and evaluation.

It includes three comparison groups to compare LfA.
1. LfF
2. BiasAdv
3. Vanilla(exposed to bias)
